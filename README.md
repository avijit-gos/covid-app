# covid-app

API which I used in this React project is https://covid19.mathdro.id/api;

Also I used som of the framwork:
1. axios: promise-based HTTP client that sports an easy-to-use API.
for installing axios:

yarn add axios
# or 
npm install axios

2. Also in this project I use chart.js for visualize data using JavaScript which is a open-source library.
for installing chart.js:

npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js
# or
yarn add react-chartjs-2 chart.js
